What a display We can't look away From the ones who get paid To stand on the stage  And the people all watch Sit and witness in silence  I see them up on the screen We all listen but they don't say anything They look so pretty and free But we can think when we are unplugged from the machine  I get my own thoughts I don't need to be taught  They don't know what I want They can't have what I've got  We can choose what we see on the silver screen We don't need this Turn it off, we won't eat all the lies they feed Watch what frees us
