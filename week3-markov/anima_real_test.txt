A. the past ainâ€™t around are you gonna be found long as you're around are you try you put it off, we give and the rhythm in all the hands we see them up on the moment the future is here or not?


B. Is it in the sky Falling from the pine Does it grow from the ashes of the fire?  I can't see it's face But it takes the shape Of the mountainside we stop to admire  We can hear it's here


C. the words but we feel light be here? the words but they feed watch what we see it's face feel light till the moment that live live in return?


D. For it lives in us, upon our earth  What does it speak of So we feel it's love Does it ask us for something in return?


E. sidewalk walkers empty vessels task completers fundamental they're all listen but we are unplugged from within let the people all the motions, keep repeating the words but we inhale, exhale the fire?


F. They can't have what I've got  We can choose what we see on the silver screen We don't need this Turn it off, we won't eat all the lies they feed 



B, D, F are all real lyrics. A, C, E are generated. My friend guessed that E, F, A were real. Got 'em.
