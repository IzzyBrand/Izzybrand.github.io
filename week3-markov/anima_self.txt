Is it in the sky Falling from the pine Does it grow from the ashes of the fire?  I can't see it's face But it takes the shape Of the mountainside we stop to admire  We can hear it's here When we inhale, exhale the head clear Holding the hands we hold dear Run from the arms of our fears and grow  How it whispers close It can't save our souls For it lives in us, upon our earth  What does it speak of So we feel it's love Does it ask us for something in return?
