And I’m here again  Caught my head in a place somewhere else in the stratosphere  How it came and went  But the thing I never knew is that all of the beauty is here   All things that live  Live in the moment  We’re what we give  Give to the moment   The future is now  Are you gonna be here?  The past ain’t around  Are you gonna be here or not?   I am listening  Forget all the plans and the pressures and thoughts ahead  Cause they don’t exist  It’s just me and my breath and the moment that I am in   All things that live  Live in the moment  We’re what we give  Give to the moment   The future is now  Are you gonna be here?  The past ain’t around  Are you gonna be here or not?
