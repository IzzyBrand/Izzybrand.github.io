Sidewalk walkers Empty vessels Task completers Fundamental They're all looking down  Can't take the time to enjoy all the space and the sound Or the look in another's eyes  No one's listening, no one's thinking No one holds their heart up high Go through the motions, keep repeating The words but we do not know why  Satisfaction Just add water Clock is ticking Cant wait longer I need it right now  The people all need to feel pleasure or they will shut down If they don't have something to hold  No one's listening, no one's thinking No one holds their heart up high Go through the motions, keep repeating The words but we do not know why  You're alive We're alive Don't you know?
